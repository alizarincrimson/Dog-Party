## Dog Party!
This is a site about some dogs.
### Motivation
This was my first exercise in recreating a page to replicate a comp. It was definitely frustrating at times but all the tinkering around with alignment and spacing really helped me get to know my code. Also I made it because Louisa said so. 
### Screenshots
